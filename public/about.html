<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>My name is Punith. I completed my engineering in Mechanical from Sapthagiri College of Engineering, graduating 
  in the 2020 batch. I have a total of 2.8 years of professional experience.
  I started my career as a Packaging Specification Analyst at Quess Corp, working on a project for Caterpillar. 
  After that, I joined ACL Digital as a Software Engineer, where I’ve spent the last 2.2 years working with 
  EssilorLuxottica on a healthcare-related application called MedFeidlity.</p>

<p>I worked as a Python backend developer in a team of around 20 members, including frontend developers, 
  UI/UX designers, data administrators, cloud engineers, and testers. My role involved building and 
  maintaining APIs using Django REST framework (specifically APIViews), focusing on modules like Pharmacy Management, 
  Inventory Management, and the Book-a-Demo feature.</p>

<p>I also implemented Celery tasks to automate key functionalities, such as checking for expired user logins and 
  sending daily transaction reports to the respective admins. In addition, I actively contributed to debugging 
  issues raised during development and testing, and ensured smooth integration of features.
  MedFeidlity is a schema-based medical application that uses separate databases for each organization. It 
  provides access based on the operational area of the organization—like lab, pharmacy, inpatient, or outpatient 
  services—with customized access control for users in each module.</p>
